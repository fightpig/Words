we
can
read
of
things
that
happened
5000
years
ago
in
the
near
east
where
people
first
learned
to
write
but
there
are
some
parts
of
the
word
where
even
now
people
cannot
write
the
only
way
that
they
can
preserve
their
history
is
to
recount
it
as
sagas
legends
handed
down
from
one
generation
of
story
teller
to
another
these
legends
are
useful
because
they
can
tell
us
something
about
migrations
of
people
who
lived
long
ago
but
none
could
write
down
what
they
did
anthropologists
wondered
where
the
remote
ancestors
of
the
polynesian
peoples
now
living
in
the
pacific
islands
came
from
the
sagas
of
these
people
explain
that
some
of
them
came
from
indonesia
about
2000
years
ago
but
the
first
people
who
were
like
ourselves
lived
so
long
ago
that
even
their
sagas
if
they
had
any
are
forgotten
so
archaeologists
have
neither
history
nor
legends
to
help
them
to
find
out
where
the
first
modern
men
came
from
fortunately
however
ancient
men
made
tools
of
stone
especially
flint
because
this
is
easier
to
shape
than
other
kinds
they
may
also
have
used
wood
and
skins
but
these
have
rotted
away
stone
does
not
decay
and
so
the
tools
of
long
ago
have
remained
when
even
the
bones
of
the
men
who
made
them
have
disappeared
without
trace
