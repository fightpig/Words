why
you
may
wonder
should
spiders
be
our
friends
because
they
destroy
so
many
insects
and
insects
include
some
of
the
greatest
enemies
of
the
human
race
insects
would
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
live
in
the
world
they
would
devour
all
our
crops
and
kill
our
flocks
and
herds
if
it
were
not
for
the
protection
we
get
from
insect-eating
animals
we
owe
a
lot
to
the
birds
and
beasts
who
eat
insects
but
all
of
them
put
together
kill
only
a
fraction
of
the
number
destroyed
by
spiders
moreover
unlike
some
of
the
other
insect
eaters
spiders
never
do
the
harm
to
us
or
our
belongings
spiders
are
not
insects
as
many
people
think
nor
even
nearly
related
to
them
one
can
tell
the
difference
almost
at
a
glance
for
a
spider
always
has
eight
legs
and
insect
never
more
than
six
how
many
spiders
are
engaged
in
this
work
no
our
behalf
one
authority
on
spiders
made
a
census
of
the
spiders
in
grass
field
in
the
south
of
england
and
he
estimated
that
there
were
more
than
2250000
in
one
acre
that
is
something
like
6000000
spiders
of
different
kinds
on
a
football
pitch
spiders
are
busy
for
at
least
half
the
year
in
killing
insects
it
is
impossible
to
make
more
than
the
wildest
guess
at
how
many
they
kill
but
they
are
hungry
creatures
not
content
with
only
three
meals
a
day
it
has
been
estimated
that
the
weight
of
all
the
insects
destroyed
by
spiders
in
britain
in
one
year
would
be
greater
than
the
total
weight
of
all
the
human
beings
in
the
country
